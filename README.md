# Description
Web application to show some cool stats about your GitHubs contributions

This is a personal project made with React

# Install
Clone the directory, go to the folder and run
`npm install` to install the dependencies

In order to run the application you will need a GitHub personal API token with permission to read user data (you can learn more about how to get your token here: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)

Once you get your token you can add it to your ".env" file with `echo "REACT_APP_GH_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN" > .env.local` and you are ready to launch the app
```
npm run start
```
__Note__: This will launch the app in development mode, if you want to learn more about React visit: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
